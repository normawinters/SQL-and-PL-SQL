Key Features Worth Highlighting

1. AI Vector Search (The Flagship Feature)
AI Vector Search allows the database to store and query vector representations of data, which is essential for capturing the semantic meaning of text, images, and other unstructured content Oracle. This includes a new VECTOR data type with dedicated indexes and SQL operators, making Oracle competitive in AI/ML workloads without needing separate vector databases.

2. JSON Relational Duality
JSON Relational Duality allows developers to leverage both relational data and the simplicity of JSON within a single app Oracle-Base. This bridges the gap between SQL and NoSQL approaches, letting you work with the same data as either relational tables or JSON documents.

3. IF [NOT] EXISTS DDL Clause
The IF [NOT] EXISTS DDL clause makes the SQL command easier to create or drop objects that exist or do not exist without receiving an error Oracle-Base. This is a huge quality-of-life improvement that developers have wanted for years.

4. SELECT Without FROM Clause
You can now run queries like SELECT SYSDATE; or SELECT 1+2; without needing FROM DUAL, improving SQL code portability.

5. Schema-Level Privileges
System privileges can now be granted at the schema level, simplifying the privilege management process Stack Overflow.

6. New Developer Role
A new developer role makes it easy to quickly assign developers privileges required for application development Oracle-Base.

7. JavaScript Stored Procedures
Run JavaScript code natively inside the database without moving data out for processing.

8. SQL Firewall
New security feature that lets you control exactly what SQL is executed against your database, protecting against SQL injection attacks.

9. Desupported(depreciated not supported any long) Features to Watch Out For
Some features will be deprecated in Oracle 23ai including: the original Export Utility (EXP), Oracle Enterprise Manager Database Express (EM Express), 10G database password verifier, 32-bit Oracle Database clients, and Database Upgrade Assistant (DBUA) Oracle-Base.
